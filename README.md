# hello-world
first repository! just figuring everything out :)
i am very interested in app development as a career! i am studying comp sci at northwestern university right now, and am going into my second year. so far, i've only learned the basics of functional and object-oriented programming. this upcoming year, i will be learning much more about computer science itself -- the math and theoretical yada yada behind everything. since northwestern doesn't currently have any specialized app development class, i will be taking this course in udacity to get started! 
after this course, i will be collaborating with two other friends to build our first app for their church :) whee!
